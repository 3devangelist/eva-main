# Instructions

## First of all Why?
Because I have an Ender5 plus that I don't want to turn in Corexy, I think many people will benefit from this mount and these mods!

# GOODIES
Front cover I have edited it because I think the current one could improve the assembly because the fan is fixed when you assemble the front cover see the video.

STLs are in the STL folder
If you need to edit you have the blender file in the right folder

I Used Blender because I Can and it's free and open-source.

Sorry this could be more polished but its life
